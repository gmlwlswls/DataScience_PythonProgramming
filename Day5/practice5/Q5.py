# 5. Sort Characters By Frequency

# Given a string `s`, write a function `frequencySort(s)` that sorts it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

# ### Requirements

# 1. **Return the sorted string.**
# 2. **If multiple characters have the same frequency:**
#    - Sort those characters in **ascending lexicographical order**:
#      - `'a'` comes before `'b'`
# 3. `s` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.
# 4. **Do not import any other module** (e.g., `collections`, `itertools`).
# 5. **Do not use built-in sorting functions** (e.g., `sorted`, `sort`).



def frequencySort(s):
    # Write your code here

    return
